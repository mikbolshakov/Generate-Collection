## Generate-Collection
Web3 application for convenient creation of NFT collections. Best suited for creating custom NFT collections that go in addition to real world assets. Application functionality:
- Ð¡reating NFT by uploading an image, adding description and recipient's address;
- Display of NFT's data in the application interface;
- Ability to add admins who can mint NFTs

### Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikbolshakov/Generate-Collection.git
cd Generate-Collection/frontend
npm install
cd ../backend
npm install
cd ../blockchain
npm install
```

### Run
Important! For each of the frontend/backend/blockchain sections, you need to create a .env file and enter the necessary variables. Feel free to ask me a question if a detailed explanation is needed.

First, deploy and verify a smart contract:
You need to specify the admin address in /scripts/deploy.ts
```bash
cd blockchain
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network chain
```

Then, run the server locally to interact with the database
```bash
cd backend
npm run start
```

After that, run the development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result:
Also you need to paste contract ABI in /src/additions
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
